# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

The Shopping Cart project has been written in TypeScript and uses context API for state management, and Tailwind CSS with its plugin Daisy UI for styling.

Technologies and libraries:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) as its plugin
